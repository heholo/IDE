        <h1>Weather Change in Copenhagen!</h1>
        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>Our motivation is to show how it has gotten warmer during the last 100 year.</p>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <p>
            The results we present below are gathered from the temperature data for Copenhagen found at <a href="https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/station_data/">nasa.gov</a>.
            The dataset contains the monthly, seasonal, and meteorological means (see <a href="https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/station_data/seas_ann_means.html">here</a>)
            for the years 1880-2017 (although we skip missing data, so in practice we do not look at 2017).
        </p>
        <p>
            For the temperature plot, we plot the yearly meteorological temperature mean as a function of year. Additionally we plot a least squares linear regression
            trend-line.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the seasonal difference plot, we plot the difference between the summer (June, July, August) seasonal mean temperature and winter seasonal mean temperature
            (December, January, February) as a function of year. Again we plot a trend-line based on LLS linear regression.
        </p>

                Our charts are based on the <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/d3noob/b3ff6ae1c120eea654b5">Simple d3.js Graph</a> tutorial, and the trend-line code is taken from

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
            The yearly temperature plot above seems to indicate that it has gotten slightly warmer over the last 100 years. However, note that the data has high variability
            which is reflected in the low r<sup>2</sup> value. Still, further evidence of increased temperature can be found in the list of coldest and warmest years
            below. We note that all but three of the 15 warmest years are after 1990 (inclusive), and likewise 1996 is the only year after 1990 which is among the
            15 coldest years.
        </p>            
        <div class="lists">
            <div id="warmest">
            </div>
            <div id="coldest">
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            We also decided to investigate whether the discrepancy in the temperature between the seasons has changed. To investigate this, we plotted the difference in seasonal
            temperature of each year.
        </p>
        <p>
            Looking at the chart, there does not seem to be a general trend in temperature difference between summer and winter. This is supported by a r<sub>2</sub> value below
            0.01 for our linear regression (and besides, the resulting slope is near non existent).
        </p>

        <p>
            In conclusion, we believe we have observed that Copenhagen has seen an increase in temperature in over the last 100 years.

            <h3>Question 1, Henrik</h3>
            <p>
                An additional data set that would help our visualization would be rainfall data for each year.
                This could be done with a line graph or a bar chart.
                More temperature data for other cities would also help make our conclusion more confident.

            <h3>Question 2, William</h3>
            <p>
                Two interactive elements would improve our visualisation: 1. it can be kind of difficult to discern the numerical y-values on our line charts,
                which could be helped by a mouseover tooltip; 2. allowing for selection of additional citites/towns could improve the argument that it is becoming
                warmer.
