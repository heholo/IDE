                (or any other election data set -- the American presidential election is another good example)
                is an example of visualising a complex data set where different readers
                have different points of interest. Furthermore, they need to present actual raw data (vote tallies) alongside
                secondary metadata (e.g. who became mayor -- which is not a direct result of the election).

                            The coloured map gives a general overview of the election results by colouring communes by party colour
                            with respect to the party color of the largest party in the commune.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            For each commune, individual and party vote counts
                            party seat counts, and actual elected councilmen alongside
                            whoever ended up becoming mayor.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This level is the most dense, and involves two visualisations.
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    The map, where now polling stations are coloured by largest party,
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    and the table window where <i>everything</i> about the results can be queried.
                                </li>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Finally, vote counts can be queried down all the way down to individual
                            polling stations (but only by party).
                        </p>

                      The map colouring allows for a brief overview of some of the
                      general trends of the election. It can for example  answer
                      the question "where is the Conservative Party popular?".
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      It is very easy to find the results in a particular commune.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="negative">Negatives</h3>
                <ul>

                    <p>
                      This map colouring could be misunderstood.
                      Especially due to the fact that
                      the party which is the largest does not necessarily reflect the political situation of a certain council.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The displayed tabular data is relegated to less that a third of the total space even though it is more complex
                      and contains most of the data.
                    </p>
