                            Letting you grey out the outcomes that are no longer possible as the matches proceed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Structuring the team by team, since most people are only interested in the outcome for their favorite team.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Using green, red and orange for the three different outcomes (classes).

                        <li>
                            We have no scalar values, so no need for bars and spatial visualization.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The small hints and explanations are good.

                        <li>
                            The greyed out outcomes continue to clutter the visualization after being removed out.
                            Could be interesting if the design became more compact as outcomes are removed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Missing a win/lose number to each team that updates as the games proceed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Missing a visualization of which team has beaten which team, to give a better overview of the head-to-head of each team.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Adding a % chance of advancement/tie-break/no-advancement for each team (assuming each match is 50/50) to get a quick overview.
                        </li>
