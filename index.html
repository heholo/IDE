                (or any other election data set -- the American presidential election is another good example)
                is an example of visualising a complex data set where different readers
                have different points of interest. Furthermore, they need to present actual raw data (vote tallies) alongside
                secondary metadata (e.g. who became mayor -- which is not a direct result of the election).
                <ul>

                        <p>
                            The coloured map gives a general overview of the election results by colouring communes by party colour
                            with respect to the party color of the largest party in the commune.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            For each commune, individual and party vote counts
                            party seat counts, and actual elected councilmen alongside
                            whoever ended up becoming mayor.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This level is the most dense, and involves two visualisations.
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    The map, where now polling stations are coloured by largest party,
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    and the table window where <i>everything</i> about the results can be queried.
                                </li>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Finally, vote counts can be queried down all the way down to individual
                            polling stations (but only by party).
                        </p>

                      The map colouring allows for a brief overview of some of the
                      general trends of the election. It can for example  answer
                      the question "where is the Conservative Party popular?".
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      It is very easy to find the results in a particular commune.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ul>

                    <p>
                      This map colouring could be misunderstood.
                      Especially due to the fact that
                      the party which is the largest does not necessarily reflect the political situation of a certain council.
                    </p>

                  <li>
                    <p>
                      The displayed tabular data is relegated to less that a third of the total space even though it is more complex
                      and contains most of the data.

                            Letting you grey out the outcomes that are no longer possible as the matches proceed.

                            Structuring the team by team, since most people are only interested in the outcome for their favorite team.

                        <li>
                            Using green, red and orange for the three different outcomes (classes).

                        <li>
                            We have no scalar values, so no need for bars and spatial visualization.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The small hints and explanations are good.

                            The greyed out outcomes continue to clutter the visualization after being removed out.
                            Could be interesting if the design became more compact as outcomes are removed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Missing a win/lose number to each team that updates as the games proceed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Missing a visualization of which team has beaten which team, to give a better overview of the head-to-head of each team.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Adding a % chance of advancement/tie-break/no-advancement for each team (assuming each match is 50/50) to get a quick overview.
                        </li>
