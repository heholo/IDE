    <h1> Show of hands (PCA visualization)</h1>
    <h2> Introduction </h2>
    <p> PCA stands for Principal Component Analysis. It is an analysis tool for reducing the dimensionality of
    data to a few features that capture the variance of the data.
    For this visualization PCA has been performed on a dataset of of 40 hand outlines.</p>
    <h2> The Visualisation </h2>
    <p> The visualisation below is in two parts. On the right, the forty hands are plotted onto the first principal component (x axis) and second principal
        component (y axis). The points can be selected and de-selected by clicking. For each selected point the outline of the corresponding hand is displayed on the left.

    <h2>Observations</h2>
    <p>
        With the plot above, we can attempt to gain some intuition on what the first two principal components describe. Looking at the <a class="left">cluster of hands
        to the left (click me)</a> we see outlines which resemble slender hands. This is in contrast to the cluster of points <a class="right">to the right</a> which are thicker.
        This indicates that perhaps the first principal component tells us something about the width of the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
        Looking along the second principal component instead, we see some slightly different pertubations. The <a class="top">top outlier</a> displays what seems to be
        a broken pinky, while the <a class="bottom">bottom outlier</a> has a fractured middle finger. Perhaps the second principal component describes finger straightness. ;)
