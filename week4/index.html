    <h1> Show of hands (PCA visualization)</h1>
    <h2> Introduction </h2>
    <p> PCA stands for Principal Component Analysis. It is an analysis tool for reducing the dimensionality of
        data to a few features that capture the variance of the data.
        For this visualization PCA has been performed on a dataset of of 40 hand outlines.</p>
    <h2> The Visualization </h2>
    <p> On the right each of the hands are projected in the direction of the first (x-axis) and second (y-axis) Principal Component.
        By hovering a point a tooltip will show which hand the point represents. By clicking on one of the points the point will be highlighted and
        a hand outline will be shown on the left. You can toggle multiple hands on and off this way and explore the data.
        The color of the point will match the color of the outline for easy identification.
        Note that the width of the visualization scale to the width of your browser - if you change your browser window
        you might need to refresh the page for the visualization to rescale properly.

    <h2>Observations</h2>
    <p>
        With the plot above, we can attempt to gain some intuition on what the first two principal components describe. Looking at the <a class="left">cluster of hands
        to the left (click me)</a> we see outlines which resemble slender hands. This is in contrast to the cluster of points <a class="right">to the right</a> which are thicker.
        This indicates that perhaps the first principal component tells us something about the width of the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
        Looking along the second principal component instead, we see some slightly different pertubations. The <a class="top">top outlier</a> displays what seems to be
        a broken pinky, while the <a class="bottom">bottom outlier</a> has a fractured index finger. Perhaps the second principal component describes finger straightness. ;)
    </p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Using the visualization help give an intuitive understanding of PCA.
        This is a great example at how visualizations can help a viewer explore and understand even complex concepts such
        as PCA, if done well.
