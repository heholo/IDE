                Since 2010, the Danish government has released a yearly list of vulnerable housing areas <i>(udsatte boligområder)</i> colliqually known
                as the "ghetto list". These lists serve as the technical definition of a Danish ghetto, a term which is used heavily in political discourse
                - particularly when it comes to immigration.
            </p>
                The ghetto topic takes up a lot of space in the Danish media landscape, and is a platform for politicial discussions related to immigration.

                To top this off, the Prime Minister's New Year's speech revolved around the Danish ghettos and how to get rid of them:

                <p>
                    Evidently, ghettos are a big deal. Additionally, being a ghetto results in tangible legal consequences. But what are they?
                <a href="http://www.trafikstyrelsen.dk/DA/Bolig/Bolig/Almene-boliger/Ghettoomraader.aspx">
                    The yearly released lists
                </a> detail which of the many Danish subsidized housing areas (almene boligområder)
                are to be labeled as ghettos according to a collection of criteria.
                Below we will detail these critera and since interpreting these numbers
                without anything to compare with is a challenge we will
                visualize the ghettos together with
                the Danish municipalities for context.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through this, we hope to gain impression of what it means to be a Danish ghetto, and what it takes to be selected as one.

                <p>
                    According to the Danish government in 2017, a housing area is considered a ghetto when it houses 
                    1000 residents and fulfills three out of five of the following criteria:
                </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <b>Unemployed:</b> The percentage of residents between age 18-64 not studying or working is
                            greater than <b>40%</b>
                            (Averaged over last two years).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Immigrants:</b> The percentage of immigrants and descendants from non-western countries
                            is greater than <b>50%</b>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Prosecuted:</b> The percentage of residents over 18 persecuted with the danish penal code (straffelov), weapon law
                            (vågenlov) or drug law (lov om euforiserende stoffer) is greater than <b>2.7%</b> (Averaged
                            over last two years).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Education:</b> Percentage of residents between age 30-59 that only has an elementary level education
                            (including uninformed) is greater than <b>50%</b>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Income:</b> The average gross income for taxable residents between age 15-64 (excluding
                            students) are <b>less than 55%</b> of the same average for the region the housing area is located in.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    The latter two criteria have been in effect since 2014 while the rest have been in effect since 2010.

                    This section shows the distribution of Danish municipalities and ghettos according to the five ghetto-list criteria.
                    Use the selector in the top left to explore the yearly data and the play button to sequence the years 2010-2017.

                    In the plots, hovering highlights a municipality of ghettos at a time. Additionally, to more easily follow the progression of a ghetto or group of ghettos,
                    clicking highlights a ghetto until clicked again and shift-clicking does the same for a municipality.

                <div class="text">
                    The difference between ghettos and the Danish municipalities is fairly stark. However, the way in which ghettos are selected changes somewhat over time:
                    <ul style="margin-top: 5px;">
                        <li>
                    The <b>crime</b> criteria, goes from covering all but three ghettos in 2010 to <i>only</i> two in 2017. Additionally, in 2017 <i>all</i> ghettos fall under
                    the non-western <b>immigrant</b> criteria. 
                            <a class="int crime">Show 2010</a>
                        </li>
                    <li>
                    Interestingly (or perhaps suspiciously), four out of five of the ghettos which pass the umemployment criteria in 2014 just barely fail the newly introduced
                        income criteria -- causing them to be classified as ghettos. <a class="int income">Show</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="ever-ghetto">0</span> ghettos have been classified as such since 2010. <a class="int unlucky">Highlight</a>

        <div id="after-histograms" class="text wide">
            <p>
                It's clear from the above that the Danish ghettos are indeed outliers in the Danish society: they are areas with low income, with high unemployment, with high amounts
                of crime or criminals, and house relatively few native Danish persons. However, the municipalities which contain these ghettos do not show the same attributes,
                and it is not clear that a municipality which contains a ghetto is generally much worse off that one which does not.

                    What follows are a few observations based on the detailed visualization above:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            If we, for 2017, compare the ghettos of Copenhagen with the ghettos of Aarhus, we can see that there is greater
                            unemployment in the ghettos in Aarhus. However the reverse is true for the municipalities: the
                            unemployment pct. of Copenhagen is almost twice that of Aarhus.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We see that crime is falling and only two ghettos in 2017 fulfill the criteria.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If we look at income criteria for 2017 we see that ghettos in Copenhagen and Høje-Taastrup, both
                            located in the Central Region, are the most represented, reflecting the fact that
                            the average income in the Central Region is larger than other regions while the income
                            in the ghetto stays low.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Looking at the last three years (2015-2017) education, immigrants and unemployment are the
                            three criteria that most ghettos are fulfilling.
                        </li>
