                The topic of danish ghettos and the yearly released ghettolist
                has become a hot topic in Denmark ever since prime minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen held
                his new years speech, where the main topic were the ghettos.

                Criticism has been raised against the image of danish ghettos that Lars Løkke paint in his speech,
                such as in these articles:

                The yearly released ghettolist (
                <a href="https://www.trm.dk/da/publikationer/2017/liste-over-ghettoomraader-1-dec-2017"
                >Ghettolist 2017</a>
                ) contains a list of subsidized housing areas (almene boligområder)
                with more than 1000 residents, that fulfill 3 out of the 5 criteria. Interpreting these numbers
                without anything to compare with is a challenge. In the following visualizations
                the danish municipalities have been evaluated over the same 5 criteria and shown
                alongside the ghettos for context.

                    The difference between ghettos and the Danish municipalities is fairly stark. However, the way in which ghettos are selected changes over time.
                    <br>
                    The <b>crime</b> criteria, goes from covering all but three ghettos in 2010 to <i>only</i> two in 2017. Similarly, in 2017 <i>all</i> ghettos fall under
                    the non-western <b>immigrant</b> criteria.

                    <br>
                    Interestingly (or perhaps suspiciously), four out of five of the ghettos which pass the umemployment criteria in 2014 just barely fail the newly introduced
                    income criteria -- causing them to be classified as ghettos. <a class="int income">Show</a>

                    What follows are a few observations based on the detailed visualization above:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            If we, for 2017, compare the ghettos of Copenhagen with the ghettos of Aarhus, we can see that there is greater
                            unemployment in the ghettos in Aarhus. However the reverse is true for the municipalities: the
                            unemployment pct. of Copenhagen is almost twice that of Aarhus.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We see that crime is falling and only two ghettos in 2017 fulfill the criteria.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If we look at income criteria for 2017 we see that ghettos in Copenhagen and Høje-Taastrup, both
                            located in the Central Region, are the most represented, reflecting the fact that
                            the average income in the Central Region is larger than other regions while the income
                            in the ghetto stays low.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Looking at the last three years (2015-2017) education, immigrants and unemployment are the
                            three criteria that most ghettos are fulfilling.
                        </li>
