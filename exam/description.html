    <h1>Main Goal: Visualize ghettos in Denmark </h1>
    <p>
        Since 2010 the Danish government has published a list of "vulnerable housing projects" (or "særligt udsatte boligområder" in Danish) also known
        as the "ghetto list". In short, if a housing area (which is slightly losely defined) which satisfies 4 out of 5 of a list of criteria
        then that area is considered a "ghetto".
    </p>
    <p>
        The ghetto list ends up being a frame of reference for public discourse, but it is not at the forefront exactly what it means to be a ghetto in Denmark.
        Through visualization, we wish to give an intuitive idea of what it actually means to be a Danish ghetto.
    </p>
    <h2>Subgoals:</h2>
    Here's a rough sketch of some of the things we would like to visualize:
    <ol>
        <li>Present an overview of ghettos. How much of an outlier are they? Where are the ghettos located geograhically?</li>
        <li>Compare ghettos with their respective municipality. How big is the difference? How does having a ghetto affect a municipality</li>
        <li>What has been the evolution in ghettos in the period 2010-2017. How is the gap between ghettos and Danish municipalities moving?</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Where Our Data Is From:</h2>
    <p>The ghetto list is published as a <a href="https://www.trm.dk/da/publikationer/2017/liste-over-ghettoomraader-1-dec-2017">PDF</a> which contains the criteria
        for the respective housing areas. We will have to transcipe a data set from this series of PDFs.
    </p>
    <p>
        For municipal data, we will make use of Statistikbanken which is published by <a href="http://statistikbanken.dk/">Danmark's Statistik</a>.
