                DR's visualisation of the
                <a href="https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/politik/kv17/resultater">
                    Danish Local Election Results
                </a>
                (or any other election data set -- the American presidential election is another good example)
                is an example of visualising a complex data set where different readers
                have different points of interest. Furthermore, they need to present actual raw data (vote tallies) alongside
                secondary metadata (e.g. who became mayor -- which is not a direct result of the election).
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The coloured map gives a general overview of the election results by colouring communes by party colour
                            with respect to the party color of the largest party in the commune.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            For each commune, individual and party vote counts
                            party seat counts, and actual elected councilmen alongside
                            whoever ended up becoming mayor.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This level is the most dense, and involves two visualisations.
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    The map, where now polling stations are coloured by largest party,
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    and the table window where <i>everything</i> about the results can be queried.
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Finally, vote counts can be queried down all the way down to individual
                            polling stations (but only by party).
                        </p>

                            The map colouring allows for a brief overview of some of the
                            general trends of the election. It can for example  answer
                            the question "where is the Conservative Party popular?".
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            It is very easy to find the results in a particular commune.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                        <p>
                            This map colouring could be misunderstood.
                            Especially due to the fact that
                            the party which is the largest does not necessarily reflect the political situation of a certain council.

                        <p>
                            The displayed tabular data is relegated to less that a third of the total space even though it is more complex
                            and contains most of the data.

                            Could be interesting if the design became more compact as outcomes are removed.

            <h3>William - Finding Correlations in the Previously Mentioned Election Data</h3>
            <p>
                The aforementioned visualisation of the election results doesn't delve much into aggregation.
                Leveraging past and present election data, it might be interesting to visualise trends, movements
                or correlations on a communal level. The data is available on <a href="https://www.kmdvalg.dk/main">KMD Valg</a>
                (with a bit
                of scraping)
                and
                <a href="https://www.statistikbanken.dk/statbank5a/selectvarval/Define.asp?MainTable=VALGK3&TabStrip=Select&PLanguage=0&FF=20">Danmark's Statistik</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, select two political parties (interactively)
                and take a scatterplot where the x-axis is the percent of votes cast for
                the first party and the y-axis the same for the second party. The results for each commune could then be plotted, perhaps
                with a shadow or trail displaying voter movement.

            <h3>Henrik - Visualizing how the odds evolve in Tour de France</h3>
            <p>
                A visualization of how the bookmaker odds on different riders change as each stage of the race is completed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Access: Getting access to the data would maybe prove difficult - you could replace bookmaker odds with
                race placements instead.
            </p>
            <p>
                Story: You could add noteworthy events from the tour (example: "Alberto Contador wins a landslide
                victory in stage 4") and see how the odds/placements reflect that. The visualization would be an
                overview of the Tour, with the interactivity to explore different aspects such as: teams or specific
                riders, certain events (yellow jersey, polka dot jersey, top 3, etc), highlighting large shifts in
                odds/placement.
