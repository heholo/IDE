            Motivation for our choices
        </h2>
        <p>
            The challenge in this visualization was how to represent the spouses in a tree structure.
            We accomplished this by making the edges connecting spouses different from the edges connecting parents and children.
            The legend was made to explain this choice to the viewer.
        </p>
        <p>
            We also made certain to signify the importance of the family patriarch Donald Trump through a variety of visual elements:
            a large portrait with a golden border and a larger and more fancy font.
